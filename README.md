# ‚è±Ô∏è Pomodoro Timer

A simple **Pomodoro Timer Web App** built with **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
This project was made to practice my JavaScript skills while creating something useful.  

The app follows the **Pomodoro Technique** ‚Äî 25 minutes of focused work followed by short or long breaks.
